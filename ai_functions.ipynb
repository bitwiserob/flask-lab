       "[text: \"The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here\\'s how it works:\\n\\n1. **Sunlight:**  Sunlight is composed of all colors of the rainbow, which we see as white light.\\n2. **Atmosphere:** When sunlight enters the Earth\\'s atmosphere, it interacts with the tiny molecules of air, primarily nitrogen and oxygen.\\n3. **Scattering:** These molecules scatter the sunlight in all directions. However, shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) are scattered much more strongly than longer wavelengths (red and orange).\\n4. **Blue dominance:** This preferential scattering of shorter wavelengths is why we see the sky as blue.  Our eyes are also more sensitive to blue light, further contributing to our perception of the sky\\'s color.\\n\\n**Think of it like this:** Imagine a tiny dust particle in the air. When sunlight hits it, the blue light is scattered more effectively, bouncing off in all directions. This scattered blue light is what reaches our eyes, making the sky appear blue.\\n\\n**Other factors:**\\n\\n* **Time of day:** The sky appears more blue during the day when the sun is high in the sky. At sunrise and sunset, the light travels through more of the atmosphere, scattering the blue light away, making the sky appear red or orange.\\n* **Pollution:**  Air pollution can scatter other wavelengths of light, making the sky appear hazy or even white.\\n\\n**In short:** The sky is blue due to the scattering of sunlight by the molecules in the atmosphere, with blue light being scattered more than other colors. \\n\"\n",
